/**
 * Chat-transcript mermaid enhancement: the shell conversation renderer
 * emits fenced code as `div.md-code-block` with the language in a banner
 * infostring element (no language class on pre/code), and the shell has no
 * slot for message-body post-processing — so this component rides the
 * conversation input dock as a zero-render sentinel and observes the
 * document for mermaid blocks the transcript mounts. Blocks inside the
 * preview panel's own subtree are excluded (each surface owns its blocks).
 *
 * Streaming awareness: an assistant message re-renders continuously, so a
 * diagram fence is often incomplete mid-stream. Renders that fail restore
 * the block and the next mutation retries it — once the fence closes the
 * diagram lands. Mutations are debounced to one rAF so long transcripts do
 * not re-scan the whole document: each batch is mapped to the minimal
 * mutated subtrees and scoped per-frame while the first scheduled pass scans
 * the body once. The observer is disconnected on unmount.
 * @module dsh-aionui-panel/client/chat/mermaid-chat

 * Disconnected nodes and removed-only records yield nothing — removal never
 * introduces a fence. Pure (DOM-read only) so tests can drive it in jsdom.
