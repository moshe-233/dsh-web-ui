/**
 * Retry supervisor: a framework-free state machine that re-runs a failed
 * turn by forking one child session from the history prefix BEFORE the
 * failed turn and replaying the original user text there.
 *
 * Why fork: the host has no in-place "retry turn" RPC, so re-prompting the
 * source session would append a duplicate user message and the failed
 * turn's stream fragments would stay in the next request's history. Forking
 * from the prefix before the failed turn guarantees the original session
 * stays untouched.
 *
 * One child per cycle (issues #797, #880): the first attempt forks the
 * child; every later attempt of the same cycle — and any retry re-armed
 * inside that child — continues IN the child instead of forking another
 * session, so one failed turn never spawns more than one extra session.
 * The child therefore accumulates one replayed message per attempt, which
 * is the retry history the user sees; the source stays pristine.
 *
 * The supervisor only watches the CURRENT session; the client wiring feeds it
 * through review() on every session/list change and cancels on navigation,
 * user input, or the UI cancel button.
